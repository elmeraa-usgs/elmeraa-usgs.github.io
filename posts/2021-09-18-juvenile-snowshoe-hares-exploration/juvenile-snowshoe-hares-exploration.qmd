### Introduction:

This mini exploratory report is on juvenile snowshoe hares in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest (Long Term Ecological Research site). The Bonanza Creek LTER is a member of the U.S. LTER Network which is supported by the National Science Foundation and by the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. The Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest (BCEF) was established in 1963 is a 50 km^2^ experimental forest located approximately 20 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska and located on land owned by the State of Alaska. The Forest is within the Tanana Valley State Forest, a unit managed by the Division of Forestry, State of Alaska. This report covers analyses including: annual juvenile hare trap counts, comparison of juvenile hare weights by sex and site, juvenile weight comparison between male & female snowshoe hares, and an analysis of the relationship between juvenile snowshoe hare hind foot length. (information regarding teh Bonaza Creek LTER network was provided from https://www.lter.uaf.edu/research/study-sites-bcef)

### Data and analyses:

This analysis contains data with counts and sizes of juvenile snowshoe hares recorded from 1998 - 2012. This report analyses: differences in annual juvenile hare trap counts (Fig. 2), comparison of juvenile hare weights by sex and site (Fig 3), comparison of mean weights for juvenile male and female snowshoe hares (Table 1), comparison of the relationship between juvenile weight & hind foot length (Fig. 4), and a linear regression describing how juvenile snowshoe hare weight changes with respect to hind foot length (Fig. 5). Following exploratory data visualization, weight between male and female hares are by two-sample t-tests using a significance level (α) of 0.05 throughout. Differences between groups are described by Cohen's d effect size. The relationship between hind foot length (mm) and weight (g) is explored by simple linear regression (Fig. 5). All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1056.

## 1. Exploratory findings

### Annual juvenile hare trap counts

```{r, fig.cap = "**Figure 2.** Annual juvenile hare trap counts (1999 - 2012)", error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## from the original hares df, mutate to make new columns of the date and then years
## filter by juveniles 
## group by year
## report those counts of juveniles by year 
hares_juvinile <- hares %>%   
  mutate(Date = mdy(date))%>% 
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  count()


## make a simple line graph of year vs count of the juvenile hare trap counts
ggplot(data = hares_juvinile,
       aes(x=Year, y= n)) + 
  geom_line(col= "red")  +
  geom_point(col = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x= "Year", 
       y='Count of hare trappings') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1999, 2012, 2)) 

# mean(hares_juvinile$n)  #to see the mean of counts from the  hares_juvinile df
# median(hares_juvinile$n) #to see the median of counts from the  hares_juvinile df
```

#### Major takeaways from Figure 2:

The max count of juvenile hare trappings was 126 in 1999. The min count of 2 juvenile hare trappings in 2010. The mean annual number of juvenile hares trapped was 31.5. The median annual number of juvenile hares trapped is 18.5. More generally, in more recent years (2005-2012), hare trapping have fluctuated quite a bit showing sharp increases followed by decreases.

## 2. Visualization of juvenile hare weights.

```{r, fig.cap = "**Figure 3**. Mean weight observations (g) for juvenile snowhoe hare weights of the three differnt sites (Bonbs, Bonmat, and Bonrip) from 1999 to 2012. With regards to color: pink (female), blue (male) and grey (NA). Box endpoints indicate the 25th and 75th percentile values; the black line indicate the median value for each sex.", error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

hares_weight <- hares %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  select(c("grid", "sex", "weight")) 

hares_weight$grid <- as.factor(hares_weight$grid)
grid.labs <- c("Bonbs", "Bonmat", "Bonrip")
names(grid.labs) <- c("bonbs", "bonmat", "bonrip")

ggplot(hares_weight, 
       aes(x=sex, y= weight)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~grid, labeller = labeller(grid = grid.labs)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x= "Sex", 
       y='Weight (g)') +
  scale_x_discrete(labels= c("Female", "Male", "NA")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 1700, 300)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

#### Major takeaways from Figure 3

This graph depicts juvenile hare weight by sex across the three sites. Site bonbs has the max weight for both male and female hares. In contrast, site bonrip has the lowest weight of female and male hares. Additionally, this graph depicts the upper and lower quartiles of each sex at the different sites. This graph also includes NA values.

## 3. Juvenile weight comparison of male & female snowshoe hares

```{r, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hares_weight_mf <- hares %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  select(c("sex", "weight")) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm=T),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=T),
            n = n())

hares_weight_mf %>%  
  kable(col.names = c("Sex",
                      "Mean weight (g)",
                      "Standard deviation",
                      "Sample size (n)"), 
        caption = "**Table 1**: summary statistics of juvenile male and female snowshoe hare 1999 - 2012") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) 
```

```{r}
# Histograms
ggplot(data = hares, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  facet_wrap(~sex, scales = "free")

# QQ Plots
ggplot(data= hares, aes(sample = weight)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

# two sample t-test
hares_weight_f <- hares %>% 
  select(c("sex", "weight")) %>% 
  filter(sex == "f") %>% 
  pull(weight)

hares_weight_m <- hares %>% 
  select(c("sex", "weight")) %>% 
  filter(sex == "m") %>% 
  pull(weight)

t.test(hares_weight_f, hares_weight_m)


# cohens d/ effect size
cohen.d(hares_weight_f, hares_weight_m, na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### Major takeaway from means comparison output:

Male snowshoe juvenile hares had the larger mean (945.8589 ± 333.2151, *n* = 163; mean ± 1 standard deviation), compared to snowshoe female juvenile hares which had a smaller mean (855.3909 ± 292.2526, *n* = 200; mean ± 1 standard deviation). The actual difference in means from juvenile male and female snowshoe hares is 11.317. The outcomes of the two sample t-test indicates there is a pretty decent chance (40%) of randomly selecting two samples from populations with the same mean that are this different by chance. In sum, the difference in means is not significant (Welch's two-sample t-test: t(2428.6) = 0.85568, p \> 0.001), and the effect size is negligible (Cohen's d = 0.0334).

## 4. Examining relationship between juvenile weight & hind foot length.

```{r, fig.cap = "**Figure 4.** Juvenile hare weights vs hind foot length from 1999 - 2012", error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hares_hind <- hares %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  select(c("weight", "hindft"))


ggplot(hares_hind, 
       aes(x=weight, y=hindft)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x= "Weight (g)", 
       y='Hind foot length (mm)') + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 1800, 400)) 

```

## 5. Linear model output

```{r}
## linear regression 
hares_lm <- lm(weight ~ hindft, data = hares_hind)

# Return the complete overview:
summary(hares_lm)

# We can use the broom::tidy() function to get the model outputs in nice data frame format:
hares_lm_tidy <- broom::tidy(hares_lm)

# Get the intercept: 
hares_int <- hares_lm_tidy$estimate[1]
hares_int

# Then to get the flipper_length coefficient:
hares_coef <- hares_lm_tidy$estimate[2]
hares_coef


#What about getting some other model information (degrees of freedom, F-statistic, p-value, etc.)?
#Many of these statistical outcomes can be accessed more easily using broom::glance().
# Metrics at a glance: 
hares_lm_out <- broom::glance(hares_lm)
hares_lm_out


# Explore model assumptions
plot(hares_lm)

# Pearson’s r
hares_cor <- cor.test(hares_hind$weight, hares_hind$hindft)
hares_cor
```

```{r, fig.cap = "**Figure 5.** Linear model of weight (g) vs hind foot length (mm) in juvenile snowshoe hare (1999 - 2012)", error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Visualize the model
ggplot(data = hares_hind, aes(x = weight, y = hindft)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              color = "red",
              size = 0.5,
              fill = "gray10",
              alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_light() +
  ggpubr::stat_regline_equation(label.x = 230, label.y = 160) +
  labs(x= "Weight (g)", 
       y='Hind foot length (mm)')
```

#### Outcomes of linear regression:

Simple linear regression was used to explore between juvenile snowshoe hare weight (g) and hare hind foot length (mm) across all sites, and including both male and female snowshoe hares. A significant regression model was found ($\beta$ = `r round(hares_coef,3)`, F(`r hares_lm_out$df`,`r hares_lm_out$df.residual`) = `r round(hares_lm_out$statistic,1)`, p \< 0.001) with an R^2^ of `r round(hares_lm_out$r.squared,3)`. The slope of the linear model is 9.523 and the y-intercept is -279.3. This slope of the linear model suggests that on average, we expect that weight to increase by 9.523 grams for each 1 mm of increase in hind foot length. Additionally, when conducting a linear model, there are assumptions such as, linearly related variables, normally distributed, Homoscedasticity and iid residuals (no serial correlation). When looking at the Residual Variances, for Homoscedasticity, it appears residuals do not appear randomly distributed evenly around the horizontal dotted line. Additionally, in the QQ plot, the residuals do not appear to be entirely normally distributed -- theres quite a few points on the tails that drift from the dotted line. This is probably partly why we see a more moderate R value (0.547).

#### Summary of juvenile hares exploration:

-   The max count of juvenile hare trappings was 126 in 1999. The min count of juvenile hare trappings was 2 in 2010. The mean annual number of juvenile hares trapped was 31.5. The median annual number of juvenile hares trapped is 18.5. More generally, in more recent years (2005-2012), hare trapping have fluctuated quite a bit showing sharp increases followed by decreases.
-   The actual difference in means from juvenile male and female snowshoe hares is 11.317. The outcomes of the two sample t-test indicates there is a pretty decent chance (40%) of randomly selecting two samples from populations with the same mean that are this different by chance. The cohend d (effect size) is 0.03389279, a negligible effect size.
-   This slope of the linear model suggests that on average, we expect that weight to increase by 9.523 grams for each 1 mm of increase in juvenile hind foot length.
-   Obtained a moderate persons *r* = 0.547 value between weights and hind foot length
