### Model Selection and Justification

**Model 1:** DV is bird mass, predictor variables are: right wing length (mm), tarsus length (mm), age of bird at capture, and sex. (I have selected this one as the final model). *Model 2:* DV is bird mass, predictor variables are: tarsus length (mm), age of bird at capture, and sex. *Model 3:* DV is bird mass, predictor variables are: age of bird at capture, and sex.

-   Warblers data set is normally distributed for mass with respect to sex.

-   When looking at the Residual Variances, for Homoscedasticity, it appears residuals appear more randomly distributed evenly around the horizontal dotted line compared to model 2 and model 3.

-   Residual plots and Q-Q plots visually show that model 1 meets the homoscedasticity and normality assumptions of linear regression.

-   AIC score for model 1 was the lowest (`r round(warblers_lm_fit$AIC, 2)`) compared to model 2 (`r round(warblers_lm_fit2$AIC, 2)`) and 3 (`r round(warblers_lm_fit3$AIC, 2)`).

-   Conceptually, including predictor variables like wing length, tarsus length, age of bird capture and sex indicate a stronger correlation to bird mass (`r round(warblers_lm_fit$adj.r.squared, 2)`). The adjusted R^2^ value here (`r round(warblers_lm_fit$adj.r.squared, 2)`) indicates that `r 100*round(warblers_lm_fit$adj.r.squared, 2)` % of variance in body mass is explained by these variables included in the model.

#### Interpreting given coeffients in Model 1:

-   The slope of the linear model was 0.0739 for right wing length (mm), 0.0743 for tarsus length (mm), -0.052 for age of bird at capture, -1.043 for sex, and the y-intercept was 4.613. This suggests that on average, we expect that bird body mass (g) to increase by 0.0739 grams for each 1 mm of increase in right wing length. We expect bird body mass to increase by 0.0743 grams for each 1 mm of increase in bird tarsus length.
