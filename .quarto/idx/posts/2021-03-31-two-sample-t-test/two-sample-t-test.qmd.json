A significant regression model was found ($\\beta$ = `r round(turtles_coef,3)`, F(`r turtles_lm_out$df`,`r turtles_lm_out$df.residual`) = `r round(turtles_lm_out$statistic,1)`, p \\< 0.001) with an R^2^ of `r round(turtles_lm_out$r.squared,3)`.\n\n### Comparing carapace lengths between green and loggerhead turtles\n\n```{r}\n## Lets just look at the raw data \n#ggplot(data = sea_turtles_clean, aes(x = species, y = length)) + geom_boxplot(aes(col=species))\n# not very different.. \n\n# Histograms\nggplot(data = sea_turtles_clean, aes(x = length)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +\n  facet_wrap(~species, scales = \"free\")\n\n# QQ Plots\nggplot(data= sea_turtles_clean, aes(sample = length)) +\n  geom_qq() +\n  facet_wrap(~species)\n```\n\n## Two sample t-test\n\n```{r}\n# two sample t-test\nturtle_length_green <- sea_turtles_clean %>% \n  dplyr::select(c(\"length\", \"species\")) %>% \n  filter(species == \"green\") %>% \n  pull(length)\n\nturtle_length_loggerhead<- sea_turtles_clean %>% \n  dplyr::select(c(\"length\", \"species\")) %>% \n  filter(species == \"loggerhead\") %>% \n  pull(length)\n\nttest <-t.test(turtle_length_green, turtle_length_loggerhead)\nttest_tidy <- tidy(ttest)\n\n#turtles_clean_table <- sea_turtles_clean %>% \n#group_by(species) %>% \n  #summarise(mean_length = mean(length, na.rm=T),\n            #sd_length = sd(length, na.rm=T),\n            #n = n())\n\n# cohens d/ effect size\ncohen_test <- cohen.d(turtle_length_green, turtle_length_loggerhead, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n### Two sample t-test conclusions:\n\n-   I used a two-sample t-test because I wanted to compare differences between 2 groups (turtle species) and compare means (continuous data) of curved carapace lengths.\n-   This analysis indicates green sea turtles had a larger mean (92.64 ± 15.78, *n* = 188; mean ± 1 standard deviation), compares to loggerhead sea turtles which had a smaller mean (89.92 ± 11.44, *n* = 95; mean ± 1 standard deviation). The actual difference in means from green and loggerhead sea turtles is 2.72. The outcome of the two sample t-test indicated that there is somewhat strong chance of (*p* \\> 0.001) of randomly selecting two samples from populations with the same that are this difference by change. In sum, the difference in means is significant (Welch's two-sample t-test: t(`r round(ttest_tidy$parameter,2)`) = `r round(ttest_tidy$statistic,2)`, *p*-value = `r format(ttest_tidy$p.value, scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`) and the effect size is negligible (Cohen's *d* = `r round(cohen_test$estimate,2)`).\n\n```{r}\n## Finalized table that shows counts and proportions of presence of burrowing barnacles to sea turtle species\"\nsea_turtles_burr <- sea_turtles_clean %>%  \n  dplyr::select(species, burr)\n\nburr_counts <- sea_turtles_burr %>% \n  janitor::tabyl(species, burr)\n\nburr_proportions <- burr_counts %>% \n  adorn_percentages() %>% \n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) %>% \n  adorn_ns() %>% \n  drop_na()\n\nburr_ct <- burr_proportions %>% \n  column_to_rownames(var = \"species\")\n\nburr_ct %>%  \n  kable(col.names = c(\"No\",\n                      \"Yes\"),\n    caption = \"**Table 1**: Association between sea turtle species and presence of burrowing barnacles\") %>% \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Chi-square test for independence\n\n```{r}\n## Chi-square test\nburr_ct <- burr_counts %>%   \n  drop_na() %>% \n  column_to_rownames(var = \"species\")\n  \nsurvey_x2 <- chisq.test(burr_ct)\nsurvey_x2\n\nsurvey_tidy <- tidy(survey_x2)\n```\n\n### Chi-square results and summary\n\nA chi-square test for independence compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another. For this analysis, there is a significant association (i.e. non-independence) between sea turtle species and and the presence of burrowing barnacles ($\\chi$^2^(`r survey_tidy$parameter`) = `r round(survey_tidy$statistic,2)`, *p*-value = `r format(survey_tidy$p.value, scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`).\n\n### Sea turtle data source:\n\n-   Heithaus, M. and J.
