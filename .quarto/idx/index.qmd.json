I'm a 2019 graduate from the University of Utah with an Honors Bachelors of Science in Environmental Biology. My honors thesis examined the effects of inorganic vs organic fertilizer on an urban lawn in Salt Lake City, Utah. I later completed two internships at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) where I conducted research analyzing the effects of rainfall gradients on future gross primary productivity (GPP) across the Isthmus of Panama. In 2022, I graduated with a Masters of Environmental Science and Management from the Bren School at UC, Santa Barbara. During that time, I worked as an Arnhold Graduate Fellow utilizing remote sensing and projected land use data to track changes in land use relating to agricultural abandonment in California and the Southeastern U.S. Currently, I am a Data Scientist/Data Visualization Specialist with United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n\nBroadly, my interests include climate-ecosystem interactions, urban ecology, terrestrial land surface modeling, ecohydrology, global carbon cycling and geophysical science. Outside of academia and research, I am passionate about environmental/climate justice, BIPOC representation in STEM, and creating open & reproducible data products.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","editor":"visual","theme":"ember.scss","title":"Elmera Azadpour","image":"images/Elmera_headshot.jpg","about":{"template":"jolla","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/EAzadpour"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elmera-azadpour-470b9a132/"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/elmeraa"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
