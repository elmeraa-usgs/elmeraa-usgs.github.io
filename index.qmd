Howdy! I am a Data Scientist/Data Visualization Specialist with United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the Water Mission Area (WMA). My work involves contributing to individual projects by applying reproducible workflows and data visualization techniques to capture and communicate complex data-intensive concepts to non-technical audiences.

I obtained a Masters of Environmental Science and Management degree from the Bren School at UC, Santa Barbara and a Honors Bachelor of Science in Environmental Biology from the University of Utah. During my time in academia, I was exposed to environmental data science and the tools that make it possible to analyze, visualize, and communicate environmental challenges. These tools have served to help me uncover patterns and support decision-making. 

Broadly, my interests include climate-ecosystem interactions, data visualization, and science communication. I am also passionate about environmental/climate justice, BIPOC representation in STEM, and creating open & reproducible data products. Check out some of my recent work: [Jazz up your ggplots](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/ggplot-jazz/), [Unequal access to water](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/vulnerability-indicators/index.html#/en), and [Mapping water insecurity in R with tidycensus](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/acs-maps/).
